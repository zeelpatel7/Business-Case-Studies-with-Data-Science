# Business Cases with Artificial Intelligence, Deep Learning, and Natural Language Processing

This repository presents six in-depth business case studies, each dissected using advanced Artificial Intelligence (AI), Deep Learning (DL), and Natural Language Processing (NLP) models. The project provides a robust framework for addressing complex business challenges through the power of Data Science, offering actionable insights and data-driven solutions.

## Case Study 1: Human Resources
### Overview:
This study delves into employee retention within the Human Resources (HR) department, identifying the Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) that most influence retention. Through comprehensive data analysis and visualization, the study uncovers critical insights into the factors that affect employee longevity.

### Tools & Techniques:
Models: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Deep Learning
Visualization: Heatmaps, Histograms, KDE Plots, Box Plots, Countplot

#### Key Insights:
Significant factors affecting retention include age, total working years, job role, and monthly income.
The deep learning model achieved an 84% accuracy in predicting employee retention based on historical data.

## Case Study 2: Marketing
### Overview:
This case study explores market segmentation in the Marketing department to optimize growth, sales, and revenue. The study focuses on a bank's efforts to understand its customer base and design a targeted advertising campaign by segmenting customers into distinct groups.

### Tools & Techniques:
Models: K-Means Clustering, Principal Component Analysis, Autoencoders
Visualization: Heatmaps, KDE Plots, Histograms, Scatter plot

### Key Insights:
High-Spenders: Cluster 6 includes customers with high purchases and credit usage.
Low-Engagement Customers: Cluster 4 seems to include customers with lower balances, credit limits, and minimal usage of their credit cards.
Segment Variability: The variability across clusters highlights distinct customer segments, which can be targeted differently in marketing strategies.

## Case Study 3: Sales
### Overview:
This study aims to predict future sales trends in the Sales department, using features such as store locations, promotions, and competition proximity. The dataset includes data from 1,115 stores, allowing for accurate forecasting of daily, weekly, monthly, and yearly sales patterns.

### Tools & Techniques:
Models: Facebook Prophet, Principal Component Analysis, Autoencoders
Visualization: Heatmaps, KDE Plots, Histograms, Line Graphs, Bar Plots, Violin Plots

### Key Insights:
Promotions significantly boost sales.
December sees a spike in customer numbers and sales.
Peak sales days occur at the beginning and end of each month.


## Case Study 4: Operations
### Overview:
This study targets the Operations department of a hospital, focusing on automating the classification of lung diseases from medical images. The study classifies conditions into four categories: Healthy, COVID-19, Bacterial Pneumonia, and Viral Pneumonia, using advanced image classification techniques.

### Tools & Techniques:
Models: Deep Learning, Transfer Learning
Visualization: [Specify visualization tools used]

### Key Insights:
The model achieved an accuracy of 82.5% on test data.


## Case Study 5: Public Relations
### Overview:
This study analyzes customer sentiment for the Public Relations department, focusing on product reviews to gauge customer satisfaction. The analysis leverages NLP to determine whether customers are satisfied, providing actionable feedback for product improvement.

### Tools & Techniques:
Models: Naive Bayes Classifier, Logistic Regression
NLP Techniques: Count Vectorizer
Visualization: Histograms, Count Plots, WordClouds

### Key Insights:
The sentiment analysis model achieved a 96% accuracy on test data.
