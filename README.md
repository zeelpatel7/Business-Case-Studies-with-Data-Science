# Business Cases with Artificial Intelligence, Deep Learning and Natural Language Processing

This is a comprehensive repository featuring six detailed business case studies, analyzed using advanced Artificial Intelligence (AI), Deep Learning (DL), and Natural Language Processing (NLP) models. This project aims to provide insightful analyses and solutions to complex business challenges through Data Science.

## Case Study 1: Human Resources

### Description:
This case study focuses on the Human Resources (HR) department and aims to analyze employee retention within the company. By leveraging data on various key parameters, we identify the Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) that most significantly influence employee retention. The analysis employs a variety of visualization techniques, including heat maps, histograms, and Kernel Density Estimate plots, to provide clear and actionable insights.

### Analysis Tools:
- Logistic Regression Classifier
- Random Forest Classifier
- Deep Learning Model
- Visualization tools: Heat maps, Histograms, KDE plots, Box Plots

### Key Findings:
- Parameters such as age, total working years, job post and monthly income impacted employee retention the most.
- The deep learning model would be able to predict the number of employees that would be retained with the accuracy of 84% based on historical data.


## Case Study 2: Marketing

### Description:
This case study focuses on the Marketing department and aims to growth, sales and revenue within the company. To leverage data science tools to understand customers and identify their needs. Data is used to perform market segmentation. This particular case deals with a bank which is trying to understand their audience to release a targeted ad marketing campaign by dividing their customers into at least 3 distinctive groups. 

### Analysis Tools:
- Visualization Tools: Heatmap, KDE plots, histogram
- K-Mean Clusters
- Principal Component Analysis
- Autoencoders

### Key Findings:

## Case Study 3: Sales

### Description:
This case study focuses on the Sales department and aims to predict future daily sales based on some features such as stores, promotions, store size, state holidays, distance from competition, etc. We also aim to predict future weekly, monthly and yearly trends. The data set in this case uses data from 1115 stores. 

### Analysis Tools:
- Visualization Tools: Heatmap, KDE plots, histogram, Line Graph, Bar Plot, Violin Plot
- Facebook Prophet
- Principal Component Analysis
- Autoencoders

### Key Findings:
- Promotions had a direct positive relation to sales in store
- There is a spike in average customers and sales during Month 12 - December
- The maximum average sales per day in a month is towards the beginning and the end of the month


## Case Study 4: Operations

### Description:
This case study focuses on the Operations department and aims to understand and label the type of lung disease based on previous historical data. This department is part of the hospital which wants to make it easier to label diseases and make their analysis quicker. There are 4 different types of categories- Healthy, Covid- 19, Bacterial Pneumonia and Viral Pneumonia. We will use Image Classification to perform our analysis.

### Analysis Tools:
- Visualization Tools:
- Deep Learning
- Transfer Learning

### Key Findings:
- Model achieved 82.5% accuracy on test data


## Case Study 5: Public Relations Department

### Description:
This case study focuses on the Public Relations department and aims to understand the sentiment of customers based on their reviews of products. This department is part of an MNC which wants to understand how to better their products. There are extensive data in text format and we aim to understand whether the customer is satisfied with the product or not. We'll be doing sentiment analysis to understand whether the product is well received or not.

### Analysis Tools:
- Visualization Tools: Histogram, countplot, WordCloud
- Natural Language Processing
- Count Vectorizer
- Naive Bayes classifier
- Logistic Regression classifier

### Key Findings:
- Model achieved 96% accuracy on test data


## Case Study 5: Public Relations Department

### Description:
This case study focuses on the Maintenance and Manufacturing department and aims to understand the defects and faults in the manufacturing of steel pipeline. The input images will be used to train a deep learning model. The ResUNet model will be implemented on the images where the defect has been detected. The goal is to automate the process of detecting and localizing defects found in steel manufacturing. The classification will be done at Pixel level.

### Analysis Tools:
- Visualization Tools: Histogram, countplot, WordCloud
- Deep Learning
- ResUNet Segmentation Model
- Run Length Encoding

### Key Findings:
- Model achieved 96% accuracy on test data
