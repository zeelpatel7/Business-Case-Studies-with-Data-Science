# Business Cases with Artificial Intelligence, Deep Learning and Natural Language Processing

This is a comprehensive repository featuring six detailed business case studies, analyzed using advanced Artificial Intelligence (AI), Deep Learning (DL), and Natural Language Processing (NLP) models. This project aims to provide insightful analyses and solutions to complex business challenges through Data Science.

## Case Study 1: Human Resources

### Description:
This case study focuses on the Human Resources (HR) department and aims to analyze employee retention within the company. By leveraging data on various key parameters, we identify the Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) that most significantly influence employee retention. The analysis employs a variety of visualization techniques, including heat maps, histograms, and Kernel Density Estimate plots, to provide clear and actionable insights.

### Analysis Tools:
- Logistic Regression Classifier
- Random Forest Classifier
- Deep Learning Model
- Visualization tools: Heat maps, Histograms, KDE plots, Box Plots

### Key Findings:
- Parameters such as age, total working years, job post and monthly income impacted employee retention the most.
- The deep learning model would be able to predict the number of employees that would be retained with the accuracy of 84% based on historical data.


## Case Study 2: Marketing

### Description:
This case study focuses on the Marketing department and aims to growth, sales and revenue within the company. To leverage data science tools to understand customers and identify their needs. Data is used to perform market segmentation. This particular case deals with a bank which is trying to understand their audience to release a targeted ad marketing campaign by dividing their customers into at least 3 distinctive groups. 

### Analysis Tools:
- Visualization Tools: Heatmap, KDE plots, histogram
- K-Mean Clusters
- Principal Component Analysis
- Autoencoders

### Key Findings:

## Case Study 3: Sales

### Description:
This case study focuses on the Sales department and aims to predict future daily sales based on some features such as stores, promotions, store size, state holidays, distance from competition, etc. We also aim to predict future weekly, monthly and yearly trends. The data set in this case uses data from 1115 stores. 

### Analysis Tools:
- Visualization Tools: Heatmap, KDE plots, histogram, Line Graph, Bar Plot, Violin Plot
- Facebook Prophet
- Principal Component Analysis
- Autoencoders

### Key Findings:
- Promotions had a direct positive relation to sales in store
- There is a spike in average customers and sales during Month 12 - December
- The maximum average sales per day in a month is towards the beginning and the end of the month
-
